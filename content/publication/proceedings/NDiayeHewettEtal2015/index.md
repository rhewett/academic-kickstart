abstract: "Optimized finite difference (OFD) coefficients are often used to minimize numerical dispersion and to improve accuracy in finite difference (FD) solutions to partial differential equations (Lele (1992); Tam and Webb (1993); Jo et al. (1996); Liu and Sen (2010); Å tekl and Pratt (1998)). We present a framework for deriving such coefficients which at once minimizes numerical dispersion and preserves convergence at low frequency. We compute optimal coefficients in each dimension and then assemble the optimal multi-dimensional stencil for the computational grid. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our OFD scheme by computing solutions to the Helmholtz equation below 3.5 points-per-wavelength (ppw)."
