abstract: "Wave atoms are a low-redundancy alternative to curvelets, suitable for high-dimensional seismic data processing. This abstract extends the wave atom orthobasis construction to 3D, 4D, and 5D Cartesian arrays, and parallelizes it in a sharedmemory environment. An implementation of the algorithm for NVIDIA CUDA capable graphics processing units (GPU) is also developed to accelerate computation for 2D and 3D data. The new transforms are benchmarked against the Fourier transform for compression of data generated from synthetic 2D and 3D acoustic models."
