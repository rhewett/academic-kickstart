abstract: "It is already understood that simple monofractal and Fourier studies of magnetic field data give a good, though imperfect, understanding of active region complexity.  We extend this work by reviewing multiscalar and multifractal approaches to quantify magnetic complexity; presented and discussed in relation to understanding and characterizing solar active region magnetic field configurations and predicting solar activity.  These differing, but complementary, approaches will be a vital component in understanding active region evolution and providing space weather prediction."
