abstract: "The Python Seismic Imaging Toolbox (PySIT) is research-scale platform for developing and prototyping numerical methods and algorithms for seismic imaging and full waveform inversion (FWI), in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions. PySIT is designed to be a common platform which implements the standard seismic imaging methods from the literature and from which the Imaging and Computing Group at MIT, and outside research groups, can quickly develop and prototype new methods, and reproducibly compare or benchmark those new methods against the state of the art in the field.

PySIT is designed to accelerate the development of seismic imaging algorithms by providing an interface that is consistent with, and in fact reads like, our derivation of the mathematics of seismic imaging. By combining this with the accessibility of the Python programming language (from both the programming and monetary cost perspectives), PySIT provides an efficient environment for incorporating new research, and training new researchers, on short time scales.

With PySIT, we aim to cleanly and efficiently provide an open platform for future development of seismic imaging methods, both at MIT and elsewhere. Moreover, by embracing an open development model, we aim to encourage cooperation within the research community and to facilitate reproducible research."
