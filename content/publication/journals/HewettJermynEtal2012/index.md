abstract: "Classical tomographic reconstruction methods fail for problems in which there is  extreme temporal and spatial sparsity in the measured data. Reconstruction of coronal  mass ejections (CMEs), a space weather phenomenon with potential negative effects on  the Earth, is one such problem. However, the topological complexity of CMEs renders  recent limited data reconstruction methods inapplicable. We propose an energy function,  based on a phase field level set framework, for the joint segmentation and tomographic  reconstruction of CMEs from measurements acquired by coronagraphs, a type of solar  telescope. Our phase field model deals easily with complex topologies, and is more  robust than classical methods when the data are very sparse. We use a fast variational  algorithm that combines the finite element method with a trust region variant of Newtonâ€™s  method to minimize the energy. We compare the results obtained with our model to  classical regularized tomography for synthetic CME-like images."
