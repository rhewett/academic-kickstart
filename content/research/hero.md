*Pay attention to this space for research opportunities.  I will post them here as they arise.*

**Postdocs:** I have no current openings.  Occasional funding for teaching postdocs may be available through the department.  Contact me if interested.

**Grad students:** Current VT MS and PhD students who are interested in working with me should contact me by e-mail to setup a meeting with me.  Prospective graduate students should also contact me to alert me to their application to VT.

**Undergrads:** I occasionally have space for undergrad researchers.  I encourage CMDA students who want to do research with me to do well in CMDA 3634, with me (prefered) or with another instructor.
