I am an assistant professor of mathematics and CMDA at Virginia Tech.  My research interests lie at the intersection of inverse problems, deep learning, and high-performance computing.  My work is motivated by problems in science with extreme data and compute scales.  I also enjoy in woodworking, photography, hiking, and visiting our national parks.  I am available for consulting.
