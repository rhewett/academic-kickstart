Prior to my son's 2nd birthday, I decided that I wanted to build an heirloom cedar toy chest for him.  I had hoped to complete it by the following Christmas.  Untold working hours and right on time, it is complete.

I have tons of photos of the build process and I'll be uploading those soon.  I'll also add some more information about the design and things that I've learned throughout the process.  Check again soon for all of the details!
